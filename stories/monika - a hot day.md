The scorching earth. Forests set ablaze, cities drowned in a fiery inferno. Anna would probably call that an exaggeration, but Monika thought it was a pretty apt description of the weather right now. It was the middle of Summer, and world wanted everyone to know it. Temperatures were through the roof, and drought had set in in a few places. Monika sat in the living room, staring out onto the fields in front of their house. The windows were wide open, but not a single gust of wind blew through them. Monika thought she could hear the hot air simmering under the burning sun, but that might have just been her imagination again. There wasn't really any particular sound, just this strange kind of general noise permeating through everything that lets you know that it's summer.

Monika groaned. She loathed summer about as much as it seemed to loathe her. Hot weather really did not become her. Over time it would transform her into a sluggish blob that just flailed about on the floor and moaned. "Weather like this should be illegal!" Monika complained. "You should submit an initiative for that, then" Anna replied, unfazed, as she went on her business in the kitchen. Monika didn't even have the will to glare at Anna, so she just groaned again. "You could go swim in the lake. I'm sure the water is nicely cool" Anna suggested, while she scoured the cabinets for ingredients. "I don't like to go swimming," Monika answered flatly. "Oh? Why not?" - "It's embarrassing," Monika mumbled quietly. "Hmm? I couldn't hear you." Anna chirped back at her. Monika said nothing and stared out the window again. It really was just way too hot.

"How can you be so chipper while this," Monika gestured lazily, "this state of affairs is going on?" Anna just hummed cheerily and figured a response wasn't necessary. Sometimes you just had to let Monika complain. "Must be in your genes or something," Monika scoffed as she stared out the window again and rocked her chair. A few minutes passed uneventfully, until Monika had finally gathered up enough motivation to get out of her chair. She slumped up the stairs and into the bathroom. A cold shower might do some good, she thought.
