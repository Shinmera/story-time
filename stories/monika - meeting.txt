== StoryTime - First Meeting - Draft 1 ==
= Location: ZHDK, small side-room
= Time: Fall/Winter 1989, a monday afternoon

{SCENE}
[Outside the room
 Monika is sitting next to the door, leaning against the wall. She's
 wearing a frowzy pullover, long jeans and a red hairclip. Monika
 appears in deep thought, not minding her surroundings.]

{ENTER: Anna}
[Anna walks down the hallway towards the side-room. She's wearing a
 black jacket, white shirt and long jeans. She looks quite well-kept
 and carries a bag over her shoulder.]

Anna approaches the door to the side-room and reaches to open the
door, but holds for thought shortly. She looks at her watch (it's 5
minutes before the lesson ends) and quietly steps aside to the other
side of the door opposite to Monika. She leans against the wall, folds
her arms and stares into space for a while, pondering about the
meeting.

Monika does not seem to take note of Anna and continues to mind her
own thoughts.

A short while passes.

Anna clears her throat and looks at Monika.

  <Anna>: So, uh do you have classes here, or?..
  
Monika snaps out of her meditation and faces Anna, a bewildered look
in her face.

  <Monika>: I- .. I- uh, no, I'm here for this.. (quietly) this silly
  collaboration thing. (louder again) I got here a bit too early, I
  guess.

Monika seems to fall back into thought and stares off into the
distance. Anna looks at her a bit confused, but doesn't respond. A few
short seconds pass and suddenly monika jumps up, smiles and holds out
her hand.

  <Monika>: Hi, I'm Monika. I'm guessing we'll be partners for this
  collaboration project, right?

Anna steps back a little, surprised at the sudden reaction. She
pulls herself together again quickly and with a rather concerned and
still somewhat confused look reaches out to shake Monika's hand

  <Anna>: Yes... My name's Anna, nice to meet you.

An awkward silence falls for a few seconds. In an effort to break the
mood Monika spouts

  <Monika>: Uh! Well, do you know what exactly we're supposed to be
  doing? I mean, I did read the paper, but...

Anna shuffles through her bag, glad to have something to do. She
quickly takes out a paper and glances over it.

  <Anna>: Hmm, well it only says here that we're supposed to design a
  poster to advertise a product, company or collective and write a short
  article describing it. ... I guess we're pretty free on doing whatever
  we want otherwise. What are you majoring in?
  <Monika>: Fine Arts bachelor, third semester.
  <Anna>: I'm doing a bachelor in design for Visual Communication. Third
  semester as well. Hmm. Alright.

The bell rings and the two step aside as the door opens and a few
students rush into the hallway. After the students left, the two enter
the room. The sun shines through a gap in the gray clouds into the
room. The snow covered landscape outside bathes the room in a chilly
and quiet atmosphere. Anna seats herself at the teacher's table up
front and waits for Monika to follow.

  <Anna>: So. Did you already prepare something for this or do you have
  any ideas as to what you'd like to do?
  <Monika>: (looks down) Uhm... well.. . No. Not really. (snaps back
  up) But I would be open for anything! ..Well, anything as long as it's
  actually a good idea of course. I mean... you know.
  <Anna>: Right... So I guess the first thing to decide would be what
  kind of thing we want to cover.
  <Monika>: Oh! How about a movie poster? .. I mean, that's a kind of
  product as well, right?
  <Anna>: Hmm, I suppose. Though I don't think that's what they meant
  with a product. Wait. (shuffles through papers) Hmm, no, it doesn't
  specify anywhere. That's annoying. I guess we could make an ad for an
  art school.
  <Monika>: ..
  <Anna>: Nah, that sounds a bit too much like a stupid joke.

They both stare at the table for a while, deep in thought.

  <Monika>: Well, I'd be more interested in making something for a
  product of sorts, since that's more specific than just a group and
  seems like an easier task to do well.
  <Anna>: Yeah. (tilts her head) But still, what kind of product? They
  left the task really open, so there's no limitations on what are
  allowed to do from what I understand. .. It should be something
  witty or clever to stand out. Making a poster is easy, but making it
  interesting enough to give a good impression requires a good idea.
  <Monika>: .. I don't think I'm particularly good at being witty
  (smiles wryly). But.. I don't know, is it really that important? I'd
  say the execution of the idea is going to make or break it in the end.
  <Anna>: Certainly, but it would be easier if we had a great concept
  to begin with.

Monika begins rocking the chair. After a while, Anna sighs and takes
out an agenda.

  <Anna>: I think it wouldn't hurt if we just gave this some
  time. When could we meet up next?
  <Monika>: (stops rocking) Well, let's see. I guess I'm pretty free
  whenever (grins). In the afternoon after classes I mean. ... Though
  I guess a Friday would be best for me.
  <Anna>: Hm. Alright, I guess that works. I don't know if this room
  will be free though, so I'd suggest we meet up in the cafeteria. Oh,
  and until then we should see about coming up with some ideas or
  maybe even making up some basic concept work.
  <Monika> (shrugs) sure.

Anna begins gathering her belongings into the bag. Monika gets up and
heads for the door.

  <Anna>: ...(concerned) Don't forget!
  <Monika>: (spins around) Oh, don't worry, I won't!

Monika grins and leaves through the door.
{EXIT: Monika}
Anna sighs, picks up her bag and looks outside for a moment before
leaving.
